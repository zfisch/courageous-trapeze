## Development

### Google Account

In order to enable the Google contacts import, a Google account, Google Contacts API key, and Google Client ID are required. Details on how to set up all these components can be found on the [Google Contacts](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/) API page.

Once you have your own Google API key and Google Client ID, set them in the `Contacts` factory in `factories.js`.

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
sudo npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
```

### Build

From within the root directory, compile all the necessary files using Grunt:

```sh
grunt
```

To have Grunt automatically watch and re-compile files upon change, use:

```sh
grunt watch
```

### Run

From within the root directory, launch the MongoDB daemon and the server:

```sh
mongod (or sudo mongod)
node server.js
```
